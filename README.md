## 👀 I’m Currently working on:
- Please have a read of my latest blogpost about [analysing GB Road Traffic Accident Data](https://gaborjenei.medium.com/a-crash-look-at-englands-road-traffic-accident-data-62049d4d95b)

   The Blog post: https://gaborjenei.medium.com/a-crash-look-at-englands-road-traffic-accident-data-62049d4d95b
   The Code: https://github.com/GaborJenei/GB-Road-Traffic-Accident-Analysis
   
- extracting transforming and cleaning text data, building an NLP, Fine tune the text classifier using scikit-learn Pipelines, FeatureUnions and GridSearchCV
     https://github.com/GaborJenei/disaster-response
- Building an API with Flask for serving the GB accident data https://github.com/GaborJenei/stats19-api

## My previous Projects:
- I have a few small, fun android app projects
- Traffic Flow Data pipeline for Highways England (closed source 😢 )

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Data Engineering
- Restful APIs, Flask

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- osPlanning/omx-python is just not working with omx files exported from SATURN. It's most likely due to a bug originating from the SATURN software, however I'm keen to look into. With the team we really hoped to utilise the benefits of HDF5 (compared to serialisation of csv files)

## 🛠️ Technologies and tools
 - Python
 - Java
